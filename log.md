##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Went back and reworked FreeCodeCamp challenges to relearn some basics.

**Thoughts**: First Day of the 100 Days of Code challenge. Late start to the day. Started around 10:30pm but it feels good to finish day one strong. Feeling optimistic.
